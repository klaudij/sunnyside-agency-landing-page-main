## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I haven't used grid in while, so this was definitely a refresher on my grid knowledge.



### Continued development

There are a couple things i want to focus on in future projects, for example how to make better hamburger menu's and adding a third breaking point.



### Useful resources

- [Gris generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app) - This is a helpfull grid generator, especially for making complex grids, i would definitely recommend this !
